# Pi Switch - Deprecated!!

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pi_switch.svg)]()

[Pi Switch](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pi_switch/) is a Python library
for the Raspberry Pi to control 315/433MHz remote controlled power sockets.
This library is basically a Python wrapper around the Arduino [rc-switch](http://code.google.com/p/rc-switch/) C++ library.

**You're on your own if you try to use this library and need help with it!**

# Notice
Please note that Pi Switch is deprecated.
There are better solutions out there for the Raspberry Pi.
Have a look at the great Python rc-switch port [rpi-rf](https://github.com/milaq/rpi-rf).
The latter is a pure Python package, without the need to compile any C++ code.
